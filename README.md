# Gale-Wind-Tunnel
This is the CAD associated with a prototype wind tunnel. I included a STP file for those not in the autodesk ecosystem.

This project was a very long ~2 year undergraduate project for my Mechanical Engineering degree. This was a solo project, so I didn't have help from my classmates but I did have a lot of help from Confluent makerspace. The physical design is from "Low Speed Wind Tunnel Testing" by Barlow, Rae, and Pope. It has proven to be a very good design. The only thing not included/modeled in this repo is that the inlet box is full of 10" drinking straws to create a laminar flow (~17k of them). The overall tunnel is approximately 9.5 feet long.

If you have any questions, contact me (email on my profile). This design is fully open source, no copyrights but attribution if using these specific files.
